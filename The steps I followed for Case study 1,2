Step 1: Download and Customize the File

Download and open the Microsoft Excel workbook Adventure Works Inventory.xlsx. The file should contain one worksheet named Products with 151 rows and 9 columns.
To use the Sort feature effectively, add a visual marker to the data. Select cells A32 to I32 and apply a yellow background. On the Home tab, go to the Font group and select the background color.
Step 2: Performing Alpha-Numeric Sorts

Sort by Product Name (Ascending): View the data organized by Product Name in ascending order.
Tip: Ensure the cursor is in the correct column before selecting the Sort option. Use Undo to reverse a sort if needed. Monitor the position of the colored row to verify the sort.
Sort by Product Name (Descending): Sort the data by Product Name in descending order.
Sort by Date Entered: Organize the data so that the oldest entry is at the top.
Tip: Excel stores dates as numbers, so this will be a numeric sort.
Sort by Supplier (Ascending): Use the shortcut Sort Ascending button to sort the data by Supplier.
Multi-Level Sort: Apply a sort that organizes the data by Supplier in ascending order and then by Units in Stock in descending order.
Tip: Use the Sort option in the Data ribbon.
Reverse the Sort: Use the Undo feature to reverse the last sort.
